<p>Privacy Policy

  Dead Works knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and I take
  your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about my privacy policy. <br/> <br/>

  What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? <br/> <br/>

  This Privacy Policy covers Dead Works's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that
  I gather when you are accessing my Website. <br/> <br/>

  What Personal Information Does Dead Works Collect? <br/> <br/>

  The information I gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve my services and to allow my users to
  set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website. In connection
  with the Website, I request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of Website, which
  allows users to identify each other. I collect the following types of information from my customers. <br/> <br/>

  Personal Information You Provide to Us: <br/> <br/>

  I receive and store any information you enter on my Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal
  Information collected may include your name, user name, password, email address, photograph or other likeness,
  purchase history, IP address, browser information and any other information you provide in connection with ymy user
  account. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
  many of my special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to
  interact with other users, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and
  communicating with you about specials and new features. <br/> <br/>

  Personal Information Collected Automatically: <br/> <br/>

  I receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with my Website or services. Dead Works
  automatically receives and records information on my server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie
  information, and the page you requested.
  Generally, my service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to my
  site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Dead Works only
  uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you
  personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or
  services so that I can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As
  part of this use of information, I may provide aggregate information to my partners about how my customers,
  collectively, use my site. I share this type of statistical data so that my partners also understand how often
  people use their services and my Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.
  Again, Dead Works never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
  E-mail Communications: <br/> <br/>

  I may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Dead Works if your computer supports this type of program.
  Dead Works uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve my service. If you do
  not want to receive email or other mail from us, please send your request to support@Dead Works.com. <br/> <br/>

  What About Cookies? <br/> <br/>

  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that I transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable my
  systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in my site are visited and by how many people.
  Dead Works cookies do not collect Personal Information, and I do not combine the general information collected through
  cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
  Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
  cookies, as Ill as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of
  each new cookie in a variety of ways. I strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, hoIver, because
  cookies enable you to take advantage of some of my Website’s most attractive features.
  Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by my advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies
  allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information
  about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver
  targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
  cookies by Dead Works and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
  Will Dead Works Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives? <br/> <br/>

  Personal Information about my customers is an integral part of my business. I neither rent nor sell your Personal
  Information to anyone. I share your Personal Information only as described below. <br/> <br/>

  Affiliated Businesses I Do Not Control: I are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In
  certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through Dead Works's Website. In other situations, Dead Works
  provides services, or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated
  business is associated with your transaction, and I will share your Personal Information that is related to such
  transactions with that affiliated business, if you have agreed to be solicited by marketing partners during the
  registration process. <br/> <br/>

  Agents: I employ other companies and people to perform tasks on my behalf and need to share your information with
  them to provide products or services to you. Unless I tell you differently, Dead Works’s agents do not have any right
  to use Personal Information I share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to my
  sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes. <br/> <br/>

  User profiles: User profile information including users’ name, email address, purchase history and other information
  you enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website.
  Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions.
  Users’ email addresses will not be directly revealed to other users by Company, except, when the user is "connected"
  to another user via a shared group membership, or an invitation, or if the user has chosen to include their email
  address in their User Profile. You may designate certain User Submissions, including individual items in your purchase
  history, as private, in which case they will not be displayed to other users. <br/> <br/>

  Communication in response to User Submissions: As part of the Website and Services, you will receive from Company
  email and other communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User
  Submissions, Company may send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion relate to
  your User Submissions.<br/> <br/>

  Business Transfers: In some cases, I may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer
  information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Dead Works, or substantially all
  of its assets Ire acquired, or in the unlikely event that Dead Works goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
  customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that
  such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Dead Works may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth
  in this policy. <br/> <br/>

  Protection of Dead Works and Others: I may release Personal Information when I believe in good faith that release is
  necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply my conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
  property, or safety of Dead Works, my employees, my users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other
  companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. <br/> <br/>

  With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with
  third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.<br/> <br/>

  feature), you may be required to provide certain personal information to relevant bands, such as your e-mail address,

  condition to each such band's right to receive such Fan Information, Dead Works requires each band to agree that it 1)
  will not not disclose, rent, or sell any Fan Information to any third party, 2) will use the Fan Information only in
  connection with the band's mailing list, in order to provide fans with general information and news about the band,
  and 3) will ensure that any e-mail sent to its mailing list will include a mechanism by which the recipient can
  unsubscribe from the mailing list, along with clear instructions on how to do so (i.e. a functioning "opt-out"
  mechanism). HoIver, Dead Works has no control over and no liability for the use of the Fan Information by the bands.
